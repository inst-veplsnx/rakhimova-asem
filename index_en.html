                        Hello! I'm a chemistry teacher with 15 years of experience and a genuine passion for my profession. 
                        Over these years, I've developed my own teaching approach that combines fundamental knowledge with creative methods.

                        For me, it's not just about conveying information but sparking genuine interest—showing that chemistry can surprise, inspire, and explain how the world works. 
                        I actively use modern tools and unconventional formats to make every lesson vibrant and memorable.

                An atom is the fundamental particle of matter, consisting of a nucleus and orbiting electrons.
